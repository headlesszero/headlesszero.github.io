<h1>Hello Sound</h1>

<p>
  The goal is simple: play voice recordings that describe power events. Eventually, Iâ€™ll use Text-To-Speech (TTS) to generate messages like, "<i>A severe power outage was detected on January 10th, lasting four hours.</i>"
</p>
<p>
  For now I just want to be able to play an MP3 file.  I didn't realize that this decision alone would trigger a bunch of confusing steps.  And as I've stated earlier, the selection of the PAM8302A was also an error.  In my defense, that was two weeks ago and I hadn't even installed Raspberry Pi OS, which is another way of saying I didn't know nuthin.
</p>
<p>
  The PAM8302A is an <b>analog</b> amplifier, great for generating tones from simple frequencies. The MAX98357A, on the other hand, is a <b>digital</b> amplifier &mdash; it can play full audio files like WAV or MP3.
</p>
<p>
  Because of delays associated with this part of the project, I completed <a href="/projects/powerzero/pixels_on_pi.html">Pixels on the Pi</a> before I got the MAX98357A boards delivered.  And this sort of fits what I'm discovering about the Pi and these external boards &mdash; you connect the wires right, maybe adjust something in config.txt, and it just works.  Wow.
</p>

<p>
  To execute the code samples, there is more detail in <a href="/projects/powerzero/remote_coding.html">Remote Coding</a>, but in short:
  <ol>
    <li>In one terminal window, ensure <code>tools/sync.py -s initialize -c learn</code> is running</li>
    <li>In another terminal window, SSH into the Pi</li>
    <li>On the Pi, cd to <code>/projects/powerzero/learning/hello_sound/</code> to see and execute the sample code files.</li>
  </ol>
  <i>Ensure you execute bootstrap config (<code>tools/bootstrap.py -s initialize -c learn</code>) before you run sync if you haven't already done so.</i>

  PAM8302A

<br>
<h2>Wiring the PAM8302A</h2>
<p>
  My first attempt was with the PAM8302A. At this point, I was feeling confident &mdash; perhaps too confident. I wired it up, ran the test code, and&hellip; well, I didn't know what I didn't know.
</p>

<h4>Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: black;"><b>BLACK:</b></span> Connect <b>GND</b> from the amplifier to Pin 6 (<b>GND</b>) on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li><span style="color: red;"><b>RED:</b></span> Connect <b>5V</b> from the amplifier to Pin 2 (<b>5V</b>) on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li><span style="color: goldenrod;"><b>YELLOW:</b></span> Connect <b>SD</b> <span class="text-muted">(shutdown)</span> to Pin 11 (<b>GPIO17</b>) on the Raspberry Pi. 
    <br><span class="text-muted">This is optional.  You can also leave it unconnected, or tie to 3.3V for always-on.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: green;"><b>GREEN:</b></span> Connect <b>A+</b> <span class="text-muted">(Audio In+)</span> from the amplifier to Pin 12 (<b>GPIO18</b>, PWM Audio Signal).</li>
  <li><span style="color: blue;"><b>BLUE:</b></span> Connect <b>A-</b> <span class="text-muted">(Audio In-)</span> from the amplifier to Pin 6 (<b>GND</b>) on the Raspberry Pi <i>(bridged with BLACK wire)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Connecting it was easy, and everything worked as expected &mdash; at least in terms of playing waveforms.  The code snippet below will play a sort of startup sound of three notes.  I'll skip the rest of the drama, but it took me far to long to realize that this board is not designed to play back digital audio files.

  MAX98357A

<h2>Wiring the MAX98357A</h2>
<p>
  After about ten hours trying to play audio files on the PAM board &mdash; then waiting a week for the MAX to arrive &mdash; I had no patience for loose wires. I bought a soldering station and got to work.  <span class="text-muted">(SEEKONE 60W Soldering Station)</span>  I used this to attach the pins that came with the package to the MAX board.  Then I could just stick the MAX directly into the breadboard.  <span class="text-muted">(And thus trade my concerns that loose wires were causing audible pops in the sound with concerns that my shoddy soldering was).</span>
</p>

<p>
  I then stuck it into the board spanning from rows <b>40</b> through row <b>46</b>.  The pins on the MAX are labeled (from rows 40 &rarr; 46) as VIN (40), GND, SD, GAIN, DIN, BCLK, and LRC (46).
</p>

<ol>
  <li><span style="color: red;"><b>RED: </b></span>  
    Plug a wire from <b>5V</b> / Pin #2 on the Pi to <b>VIN</b> on the amplifier (row 40).</li>

  <li><span style="color: black;"><b>BLACK: </b></span>  
    Plug a wire from <b>GND</b> / Pin #6 on the Pi to <b>GND</b> on the amplifier (row 41).</li>

  <li>Bridge breadboard VIN (row 40) &rarr; <b>SD</b> (row 42).</li>
  <li>Bridge breadboard GND (row 41) &rarr; <b>GAIN</b> (row 43).</li>

  <li><span style="color: blue;"><b>BLUE: </b></span>

<p>
  <b class="text-primary">Adding the Speaker</b><br>
  The MAX98357A provides <b>mono output</b>, so we connect one speaker:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="color: red;"><b>RED: </b></span>  
    Connect the positive (+) speaker wire to the speaker + terminal on the PAM board.</li>

  <li><span style="color: black;"><b>BLACK: </b></span>  
    Connect the negative (-) speaker wire to the speaker - terminal on the PAM board.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3>Configuring Bootstrap</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/static/images/powerzero/hello_sound/config_i2s.jpg" alt="configuration .ini file image for RTC" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
</p>
<p>
  To avoid being repetitive, reference the <a href="/projects/powerzero/remote_coding.html">Remote Coding</a> on how to deploy the configuration to the Pi.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Playing More than Beeps and Boops</h3>
<p>
  Want to check if your speaker even works? Start with <code>speaker-test</code>.  SSH into the Pi and run this command:
</p>
<div class="rounded shadow" style="background-color: #2d2d2d; border: 1px solid #2d2d2d;"><pre><code class="language-bash">speaker-test -D hw:0,0 -c 2 -t sine -f 1000</code></pre></div>

<br>
<p>
  Now assuming that's working, you should hear a tone alternating between the left and right speaker.  Since we only have one speaker on the MAX, you'll only hear the tone when it plays in the left.  You can also play something using <code>aplay</code>:
</p>
<div class="rounded shadow" style="background-color: #2d2d2d; border: 1px solid #2d2d2d;"><pre><code class="language-bash">aplay -D plughw:0,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
</code></pre></div>
<br>
<p>
  If everything is wired correctly, you should hear "Front Center" through the speaker.
</p>
<p class="text-danger">
  <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>  If you read ahead and decided to pre-emptively connect the <b>SD</b> to a GPIO pin, no sound will come out with the aplay command.  <i>speaker-test</i> will work, but <i>aplay</i> will just click as the board powers up and then nothing.  Ensure SD / breadboard row 42 is connected to 5V power for aplay to work.  I had a few hours of fun figuring out why this command suddenly stopped working, but my code did.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  <b class="text-primary">Pop Pop Pop</b><br>
  Whenever you play a sound, you'll probably hear a loud popping sound.  To get rid of this, we need to do two things:
  <ol>
    <li><span style="color: goldenrod;"><b>YELLOW: </b></span> Plug a wire from the <b>SD</b> (row 42) to <b>GPIO 23</b> (Pin 16) on the Pi.</li>
    <span class="text-muted">Of course, you need to remove the jumper connecting rows 40 &rarr; 42.</span>
    <li>Turn the amplifier on and stabilize it before playing a sound.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<br>
<p>
  <b class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-angry"></i> 2V-5.5V?  I don't think so.</b><br>
  From what I read the PAM has a wide operating range from ~2-5V.  I decided to use the 3.3V for no particular reason, but why not?  It's in the middle of the range.  I couldn't get quality sound without plugging it into the 5V.  When I did, suddenly the audio became super clear and the static went away.
</p>

<br>
<p class="text-primary"><i class="fas fa-history"></i> <b>Future Me Discovery:</b></p>
<p>
  I sort of ignored the GAIN because it didnâ€™t seem I needed it. I just grounded it. Turns out, grounding GAIN sets the amplifier gain to +3 dB, while leaving it floating increases it to +15 dB. I had inconsistent results, so I decided to keep it bridged.
</p>
<p>
  Also, what is a decibel? There doesnâ€™t seem to be a volume control per se, like thereâ€™s no knob that goes from 1 â†’ 11.  
  Instead, you modify it by some number of dB, which changes the <b>gain</b>, which in turn affects how much power (watts) goes to the speaker.  
  But hereâ€™s the trick: itâ€™s a <b>logarithmic scale</b>, not linear.
</p>
<p>
  If by default you have 1 watt going to the speaker:
  <ul>
    <li><b>+3 dB â†’</b> Doubles the power (1W &rarr; 2W)</li>
    <li><b>+10 dB â†’</b> 10Ã— the power (1W &rarr; 10W)</li>
    <li><b>+20 dB â†’</b> 100Ã— the power (1W &rarr; 100W)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  But hereâ€™s where it gets weird: power is <b>not</b> the same as how loud it sounds.  
  We donâ€™t hear in a linear way either:
  <ul>
    <li><b>+10 dB sounds about twice as loud</b> (not 10Ã— louder).</li>
    <li><b>-6 dB cuts power in half, but it wonâ€™t sound half as loud</b> &mdash; just a bit quieter.</li>
  </ul>
  I still havenâ€™t gained an intuitive feel for this yet, and Iâ€™ll play with it more in the final project code.  The key point is that itâ€™s not a simple volume control in the way youâ€™re used to thinking about it.  I now wonder about the scale used in the volume knob on my old Yamaha amplifier.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
  Sound? <b>Working</b>. Now, time to make the Pi <i>show</i> something too.
