  <i>PowerZero</i> is a beginner-friendly Raspberry Pi project presented from concept, through development, and into final product.
</p>
<p>
  This Table of Contents provides an overview of each step in the project. Keep in mind that the pages were written contemporaneously with active development, meaning earlier entries may not fully align with the final implementation.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that this is my very first Pi project, and I’m trying to document it for people who might be as new to this as I am. If you’re already experienced, feel free to skip past the earlier pages where I’m just getting started&mdash;like setting up my dev environment or <span style="color:grey"><s>screaming at Google</s></span> trying to figure out why the Pi won't respond to a ping.

  PART 1: THE IDEA

-->

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/index.html">The Idea</a></h4>
  <p>The idea behind PowerZero.  This page outlines the starting plan for the project.  Importantly it outlines the framework for decision making:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Objectively Useful:</b> It must solve a real-world problem.</li>
    <li><b>Accessible Simplicity:</b> It must be easy enough for anyone to use without confusion; and,</li>
    <li><b>Achievable Scope:</b> All features must be clearly required in service to usefulness and simplicity.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

  PART 2: SETTING UP THE PI

<br>
<p class="fs-3">Part 2: Setting up the Pi</p>
<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/hello_world.html">Hello World</a></h4>
  <p>
    I get the Raspberry Pi running (headless) and excute a simple "Hello World" Python script directly on the Pi.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was having so much fun in this initial step that I decided to create HeadlessZero <a href="/docs">Bootstrap</a>. Now I can focus on creating PowerZero and future projects without having to spend time on installation and configuration.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/remote_coding.html">Remote Coding</a></h4>
  <p>
    I set up a development environment so that I can get started.  I'll make it more robust later, but for now I keep it to the basic requirements:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>I develop on my Mac (or PC), not directly on the Pi.</li>
    <li>When I make code changes on the Mac, it automagically shows up on the Pi.</li>
    <ul><li><b>The code on the Mac is authoritative</b>, <i>not the code on the Pi</i>.</li></ul>
    <li>I can access the Pi via SSH, and test the code by running a single Python script.</li>
  </ol>

  PART 3: LEARNING THE COMPONENTS

<p class="fs-3">Part 3: Learning the Components</p>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/button_and_led.html">A Button and an LED</a></h4>
  <p>
    I want to start with the easiest part of the project.  Detecting when the user presses a button, and making something change visibly (the LED) as a result.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/time_unplugged.html">Time Unplugged</a></h4>
  <p>
    One of the most critical components in this build is the real-time clock (RTC)&mdash;a device with its own battery backup to retain time, even during power outages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Normally, the Raspberry Pi retrieves the current time at boot using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) over an internet connection. However, following the principle of <b>accessible simplicity</b>, I want to eliminate the need for an internet connection&mdash;or the end-user hassle of setting one up. To achieve this, the build incorporates a DS3231 RTC module.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/hello_sound.html">Hello Sound</a></h4>
  <p>
    I try to get the Pi to make a sound.  More specifically, to play some sort of sound file as a proof of concept for the final project.  After a lengthy misadventure with the PAM8302A, I realize I need a different component.

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/pixels_on_pi.html">Pixels on the Pi</a></h4>
  <p>
    I decided that the display is not optional to hit the usability I would like to achieve.  I have a few options that I want to try out.

  PART 4: PUTTING IT TOGETHER

<p class="fs-3">Part 4: Putting it all Together</p>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/prototype_zero.html">Prototype Zero</a></h4>
  <p>
    Using a breadboard to prototype with, I want to get everything working together end-to-end:
    <ul>
      <li>All components assembled on a breadboard.</li>
      <li>Install to device via powerzero/tools; and,</li>
      <li>Demo of all components working together.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: smaller;" class="text-warning"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
    Coming soon.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/prototype_one.html">Prototype One</a></h4>
  <p>
    In the second prototype I transition away from a breadboard and affix all the parts into a reasonably small package.  All the major features of the product work, and I've made final decisions on the hardware and design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Requirements:
    <ol>
      <li>It is self-contained.</li>
      <li>All features are implemented; and,</li>
      <li>Someone other than me can easily figure it out and use it.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: smaller;" class="text-warning"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
    Coming soon.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/fitting_the_build.html">Fitting the Build</a></h4>
  <p>
    In this final prototyping stage, I collaborate with a talented industrial designer to refine the enclosure and create a polished, functional physical product. This step ensures everything fits together seamlessly, balancing aesthetics, usability, and practicality to bring the vision to life.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: smaller;" class="text-warning"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
