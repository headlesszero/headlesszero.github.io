  <i>PowerZero</i> is a beginner-friendly Raspberry Pi project presented from concept, through development, and into final product.
</p>
<p>
  This Table of Contents provides an overview of each step in the project. Keep in mind that the pages were written contemporaneously with active development, meaning earlier entries may not fully align with the final implementation.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that this is my very first Pi project, and I’m trying to document it for people who might be as new to this as I am. If you’re already experienced, feel free to skip past the earlier pages where I’m just getting started&mdash;like setting up my dev environment or <span style="color:grey"><s>screaming at Google</s></span> trying to figure out why the Pi won't respond to a ping.

    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/index.html">The Idea</a></h4>
    <p>The idea behind PowerZero.  This page outlines the starting plan for the project.  Importantly it outlines the framework for decision making:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Objectively Useful:</b> It must solve a real-world problem.</li>
      <li><b>Accessible Simplicity:</b> It must be easy enough for anyone to use without confusion; and,</li>
      <li><b>Achievable Scope:</b> All features must be clearly required in service to usefulness and simplicity.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p class="fs-3">Part 2: Setting up the Pi</p>
  <div class="card">
    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/hello_world.html">Hello World</a></h4>
    <p>
      I get the Raspberry Pi running (headless) and excute a simple "Hello World" Python script directly on the Pi.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was having so much fun in this initial step that I decided to create HeadlessZero <a href="/docs">Bootstrap</a>. Now I can focus on creating PowerZero and future projects without having to spend time on installation and configuration.

  <div class="card">
    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/remote_coding.html">Remote Coding</a></h4>
    <p>
      I set up a development environment so that I can get started.  I'll make it more robust later, but for now I keep it to the basic requirements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I develop on my Mac (or PC), not directly on the Pi.</li>
      <li>When I make code changes on the Mac, it automagically shows up on the Pi.</li>
      <ul><li><b>The code on the Mac is authoritative</b>, <i>not the code on the Pi</i>.</li></ul>
      <li>I can access the Pi via SSH, and test the code by running a single Python script.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p class="fs-3">Part 3: Learning the Components</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/button_and_led.html">A Button and an LED</a></h4>
    <p>
      I want to start with the easiest part of the project.  Detecting when the user presses a button.  I figure out how to detect both single and long presses.
