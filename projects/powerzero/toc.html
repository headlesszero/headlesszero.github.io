  <i>PowerZero</i> is a beginner-friendly Raspberry Pi project presented from concept, through development, and into final product.
</p>
<p>
  This Table of Contents provides an overview of each step in the project. Keep in mind that the pages were written contemporaneously with active development, meaning earlier entries may not fully align with the final implementation.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that this is my very first Pi project, and I’m trying to document it for people who might be as new to this as I am. If you’re already experienced, feel free to skip past the earlier pages where I’m just getting started—like setting up my dev environment or <span style="color:grey"><s>screaming at Google</s></span> trying to figure out why the Pi won't respond to a ping.

    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/index.html">The Idea</a></h4>
    <p>The idea behind PowerZero.  This page outlines the starting plan for the project.  Importantly it outlines the framework for decision making:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Objectively Useful:</b> It must solve a real-world problem.</li>
      <li><b>Accessible Simplicity:</b> It must be easy enough for anyone to use without confusion; and,</li>
      <li><b>Achievable Scope:</b> All features must be clearly required in service to usefulness and simplicity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a href="/projects/powerzero/hello_world.html">Hello World</a></h4>
    <p>I figure out how to setup my development environment so that I can write code on my Mac (or PC) and test it on the Pi.</p>
    <p>I was having so much fun in this initial step that I decided to create <a href="/">Headless Zero</a> so that I could focus on creating PowerZero and future projects and not have to fight with configuration.</p>
