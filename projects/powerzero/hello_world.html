<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>The plan was simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite</li>
  <li>SSH into the Pi</li>
  <li>Create a hello_world.py file and execute it</li>
  <li>Have a beer and start planning next steps</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3>1. Installing Raspberry Pi OS Lite</h3>
<p>
  I don't have much to add here.  The documentation is fantastic, and the installer works great!  It's difficult to go wrong.
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html">Official Getting Started Documentation</a>.
</p>

<br>
<h3>2. SSH Into the Pi</h3>
<p>
  I think it started to go wrong in step 1.  At some point I stopped reading and started skimming.  Also, I want the Pi to be 100% headless &mdash; <i>I view the Pi as the brains of a physical product, not a computer to play with </i> &mdash; the documentation mentioned an HDMI cable, a keyboard, and some fancy looking desktop running on the Pi.  Anyway. In my wisdom, I left the documentation behind and started Googling.
</p>
<p>
  The details aren't interesting, but I will share a few gotchas I learned along the way:
  <ul>
    <li>You can SSH into the Pi even if you can't ping it.</li>
    <li>If you want to connect to the Pi via USB:
      <ul>
        <li>You need to enable Gadget Mode (which enables your USB0 port to act as a network port).</li>
        <li>There is a specific port for Gadget Mode, and it's not the Power Port.</li>
        <li>It's a bad idea to both power the Pi <i>and</i> run data to your Pi from the same computer using two USB cables.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The ratings on USB cables matter:
      <ul>
        <li>Power Cables and Data Cables aren't the same thing.</li>
        <li>Using a converter dongle, like adapting USB-C to Micro USB, may turn a Data Cable into a Power Cable.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Order of operations matters; it won't auto connect without at least some configuration I haven't yet discovered unless:
      <ol>
        <li>Power off Pi</li>
        <li>Insert Data Cable</li>
        <li>Power on Pi</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Once I finally got the Pi working, I reflashed it to ensure I understood the process.  I would like to say that it was faster the second time.  At this point, I realized manual setup wasnâ€™t for me.  I did the only logical thing and wrote some code to handle it consistently and reliably: <a href="/docs/">Bootstrap</a>.

<h3>3. Create hello_world.py</h3>
<p>
  Some time later, I'm finally ready for Hello World!  It's time to SSH into the device and create the file.
<p>
  <p>
    Unless you changed the config, the default username is <b>pi</b>, and the default password is <b>raspberry</b>.  The default device name is <b>raspberrypi</b>.  This means you can access it via SSH on the command line with:

    <div class="rounded shadow" style="background-color: #2d2d2d; border: 1px solid #2d2d2d;">
      <pre><code class="language-bash">ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code></pre>
    </div>

    <span style="font-size:smaller; color:gray;">If you want to ping it first to confirm it exists on the network, it won't respond.  But that doesn't mean you can't SSH into it.</span>

    <img src="/static/images/powerzero/hello_world_cli.jpg" alt="Screenshot: SSH Into Device" class="image-center">

    And you can create the text in your home folder with:
    <pre>nano hello_world.py</pre>

    <img src="/static/images/powerzero/hello_world_code.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Hello World Python Code" class="image-center">

    Press <b>Ctrl-O</b> to save the file, then <b>Ctrl-X</b> to exit nano.  And now we can run the test!

  </p>


<br>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    Now that this is working, I need to setup my dev environment so that I can code on my Mac instead of using Nano.  The parts I ordered should arrive in the next few days and I want to be ready!
