          <h1>About Headless Zero</h1>
<p>
  I’m a new maker. I had just unboxed my first Raspberry Pi imagining jumping straight into coding and building fun projects, but instead, I found myself wrestling with Linux, configurations, and troubleshooting.
<p>
<p>
  What I thought would be a creative adventure turned into a frustrating setup process. I just wanted it to work. And I couldn’t imagine handing a project to family or friends and having to walk them through a maze of steps just to connect it to their WiFi.
</p>
<p>
  That’s when I decided that before I could “make” I needed to find a way to configure and deploy in an easy, consistent, and reliable way.

<h4>Introducing HZ Bootstrap:</h4>
<p>
  <b>HZ Bootstrap</b> is a library that streamlines Raspberry Pi development. 
  Whether you're setting up a new device, developing interactively, or 
  preparing a product for end users, Bootstrap makes the process easier.
</p>

<!-- Key Features Section -->
<h4>Why Use Bootstrap?</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Headless Setup</b> &mdash;  Never requires a monitor or keyboard.</li>
  <li><b>Automated Deployment</b> &mdash; Go from a fresh install to production-ready with a single command.</li>
  <li><b>Configurable</b> &mdash;  A single <code>.ini</code> file defines your entire system setup.</li>
  <li><b>Extensible</b> &mdash;  Add custom components to automate and configure exactly what you need.</li>
</ul>

  <i class="fas fa-seedling" title="Starter Project" style="color: #33c833;"></i> And if you're as new to this as me, you might find my first project (<a href="/projects/powerzero/">PowerZero</a>) interesting as a beginner-friendly starting place.  I literally go from never having seen a Pi before, through setting up a development environment, all the way to project completion.
