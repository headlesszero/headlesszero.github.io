          <h1>About Headless Zero</h1>
<p>I’m a new maker. I had just unboxed my first Raspberry Pi imagining jumping straight into coding and building fun projects, but instead, I found myself wrestling with Linux, configurations, and troubleshooting. <p>
<p>What I thought would be a creative adventure turned into a frustrating setup process. I just wanted it to work. And I couldn’t imagine handing a project to family or friends and having to walk them through a maze of steps just to connect it to their WiFi.</p>
<p>That’s when I decided that before I could “make” I needed to find a way to configure and deploy in an easy, consistent, and reliable way.</p>
<p>I hope this tool (HZ Bootstrap) helps you focus on the parts of your project that you enjoy most. And if it sparks ideas on how to improve HZ, I’d love your help in building a community to make it more useful for more people.</p>
